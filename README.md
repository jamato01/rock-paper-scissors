TOP's Rock Paper Scissors Project

This project is to sharpen my new skills in javascript. The game is to be played in the Devtools Console.

## Rules
1. Each round, the browser will prompt you to enter "Rock, Paper, or Scissors". Enter one of these 3, case insensitive.
2. Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. Whoever wins between you and the computer will get a point.
3. Ties are no points for either party.
4. After 5 rounds, a winner will be decided!
